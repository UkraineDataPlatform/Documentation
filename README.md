# Ukraine Data Platform - Documentation and Information Hub

This repository holds the files for Welsh Government's Ukraine Data Platform Documentation site.

## Updating site files

Navigate to the 'gh-pages' branch via the branches drop-down list at the top-left of the repository screen (labelled 'main')
Click on 'Add file' and select 'Upload files' from the menu.
Drag your updated site files into the upload window or select them from your file explorer via the 'choose your files' link
Add a commit message and click on 'commit changes' to proceed with upload.
You will be notified that processing may take a while if you are uploading a lot of files at once
Files with the same name as older ones will overwrite them in the repository (this is often the desired action)
