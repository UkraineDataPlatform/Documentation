                <p>To search for record, there are two ways to search on the system.</p>
                <p>The first is to use the box, the search box here, which gives you search results based on whichever section of the system you're in.</p>
                <p>So, if we put in the surname Jones here and you can either press enter or click on the magnifying glass that will return all of the results of people with the surname Jones under the Applicant section of the system.</p>
                <p>If you want to do a wider search of the whole system, you can click the magnifying glass in the top menu, and again we type in the surname Jones, and this will return wider search results which include both sponsors and applicants to the scheme.</p>
