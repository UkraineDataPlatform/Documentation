                    <p>To search for record, there are two ways to search on the system.</p>
                    <p>The first is to use the box, the search box here, which gives you search results based on whichever section of the system you're in.</p>
                    <p>So, if we put in the surname Jones here and you can either press enter or click on the magnifying glass that will return all of the results of people with the surname Jones under the Applicant section of the system.</p>
                    <p>If you want to do a wider search of the whole system, you can click the magnifying glass in the top menu, and again we type in the surname Jones, and this will return wider search results which include both sponsors and applicants to the scheme.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>As individuals on the Super Sponsor and Individual Sponsorship schemes move through our systems, it'll be necessary to change their journey status codes to reflect their progress.</p>
                    <p>So we can change that for both individual records, and we can also do that through the household ID to edit the records at the same time of all of the members of the household.</p>
                    <p>So to edit one person's record, so in this case Carol's record, we come to the SS journey status and we click the dropdown and once you're ready to change their status, you simply click the next status on the list and save.</p>
                    <p>And that has now applied that status change to Carol's record.</p>
                    <p>Now if we click on the household ID, you can see that we have another member of the household and this person is also ready to move on and to change their journey status.</p>
                    <p>So in fact, if we wanted to change the records of everyone in the household group, we come to the table at the bottom of the screen and we click Select All.</p>
                    <p>And then where we have the Edit button, this enables us to edit the two records at the same time. So we go to the SS journey status, the same dropdown that we had for the individual screen, and we click SSO8, Ready for Move On, and we click Save.</p>
                    <p>And those two records have now been saved and that ensures that the whole household now all have the same status code and are ready for move on.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Some individuals coming through our schemes may have complex cases,and what we mean by complex cases is that they may have additional health or well-being concerns or safeguarding concerns which local authorities need to be aware of due to the nature of the system not being designed to handle sensitive information.</p>
                    <p>It's important to have a means of flagging complex cases on this system and ensuring that anyone handling that case can refer to local information and local files for further details on the complexity and the nature of those cases</p>
                    <p>So to add a complex case note, we come to an individual's record. So we'll use Rachel in this case.</p>
                    <p>On Rachel's record, we're going to first add a 'Yes' at the top here to indicate that shehas complex case and we're going to also enter a note to say. Complex Case and with that we can say,"please speak to N Jones for further information".</p>
                    <p>And that just means that we can flag who the person is that has the information or that is the best person to speak to for further details on this case.</p>
                    <p>So when we save,that note is added under complex case and you can see that the flag here is yes. If we then come out of the record, when you go back into Rachel's record in future, if you double click, you're instantly shown that there is a complex case flag on this system.</p>
                    <p>So that means that nobody can access this record without being aware that this is a complex case and that they need to refer to local case notes for further information to provide the right support available.</p>

                <div class="transcript">
                    <p>The platform has been developed to enable you to capture where checks and appointments have been undertaken on the system and also to add any case notes and activities which identify actions that have taken place to support that person.</p>
                    <p>If we have a look on Joanna's record here, you can see that we have a box on the right-hand side for individual sponsor applicant checks and these are checks that are specific to people who are on the individual sponsorship route.</p>
                    <p>So when you as a local authority have undertaken a particular action, you can change this toggle box here in order to make sure that you capture that the action has taken place.  So in this case, we could say that a welfare visit has been completed and then interim payment of £200 has been made.</p>
                    <p>We can change those toggles to yes and click save and that ensures that that record has been updated.  We can also do this for multiple individuals as well.  So if we were to search in the system for a family group and we can look at this particular household.</p>
                    <p>So the lead contact, the lead applicant is Stephen and we can see that we have some checks here that are relative to the Super Sponsor Scheme. You can undertake these checks individually for each person within the household or you can actually update the checks at the same time for both members of the household.</p>
                    <p>As you can see we have both Stephen and Alexandra.  To update sponsor super applicants or individual sponsor applicant checks at the same time, whichever scheme they're on, a tab is available here which enables you to update their actions at the same time.</p>
                    <p>So if we wanted to say that both Alexandra and Stephen have had their medical screening. We can use this tab and this box in order to quickly update their records and we can either use the save button at the top here or the tiny little disc save button on the right-hand side here. And that has updated their records so that if we went back to look at their individual records you would now be able to see on Stephen's individual record that that welcome centre medical screening button has changed to a yes.</p>
                    <p>And if we were to go and look at his relative, Alexandra's record here, which we can use this navigate button to do, we can also see that she has had this button changed to a yes,  so that's a means of changing the checks for multiple members of a household at the same time.</p>
                    <p>One other check that it's important to show you is around sponsors.  For example, if we have a sponsor who has a household, so who has other members of their household that need to complete a DBS check, such as these sponsor checks over here, we would only change these toggles when we’re satisfied that ALL members of the household that require a DBS check and have them completed.   So not just the sponsor but any members of the household.</p>
                    <p>And once you're satisfied that those checks have been completed for all sponsor household members that need them, then you can change that tab. And you can save that as well and that's a record that you've completed that note. </p>
                    <p>All the while we've got case notes and activities here, and you can simply add a note here to say checks have been undertaken.  And you can add further notes in to say that the DBS check was done for all relevant members of the family.</p>
                    <p>By adding notes into this section, it ensures that the next person in your team that comes along can see the activities that have taken place in relation to those checks, or indeed to anything else that you feel is important to add onto a person's record.</p>
                    <p>There are many different notes that you may wish to capture, particularly where, for example, you may have a person who has a complex case.  A complex case is, as referred to in the other video, where somebody might have a particular health or medical requirement or a sensitive case that that we require some sensitive handling and so those can also be added in the case notes here and press save.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="transcript">
                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Housing need records reflects the type of housing and accommodations that an individual or family may need when they move to Wales. In order to understand the requirements that they have, we create a housing need record which captures the information on the types of bedrooms, number of rooms, number of beds, whether they have pets, and any additional accessibility requirements that they have so that they can be provided appropriate accommodation when they arrive.</p>
                    <p>The people that are arriving on the individual sponsor scheme will need their housing needs to be updated by the local authority, and so I'll show you how to do that now.</p>
                    <p>So we're going to pick under the Household section or the Applicant section. You can search for an individual as I'm just going to search by a person's name and that person is called Brian.</p>
                    <p>And as we can see here, Brian has come up in the active households table. They have a Household ID, but they do not have a housing need yet and so we need to create that. So if you click double click here in the family ID line and you can see that housing need is not attached.</p>
                    <p>So the first thing we're going to do is click with the left button of your mouse in this box and you can see here that we have the ability to create a new housing need. So click on this link. And when this opens, it will lead us to a blank housing need record that we can now create.</p>
                    <p>So if you click in the first box for Applicant, you can see that Brian is the first person that we've been most recently dealing with and his record is at the top.</p>
                    <p>So we can click Brian and that immediately populates his household ID as well. Now we know that Brian is a single person who's a household of 1, so that will require single in this box. He's also travelling on the individual sponsor scheme and so we can update that as well.</p>
                    <p>You'll notice that it's only the fields that have a red asterisk which need to be created, which need to be completed, but you can complete other data if you have it as well and if it's useful to you.</p>
                    <p>As we scroll down the page, you can see the main requirements and we can start to fit in here any information that we know about Brian and his requirements. So we know that it's a one person family and it's one adult. There are no children and Brian is 45, and he is male, so we'll put an M in this box. He's going to require one bedroom and one bed, and then we can start picking if there are any other aspects that he needs.</p>
                    <p>So for example, he doesn't need a wheelchair or accessible property. So we'll keep this as no, he doesn't have any pets and he doesn't have any of the aspects of this form that we need to complete.  But you can do if it's relevant to the individual whose form you're completing.</p>
                    <p>So this if we click save will create a household ID and a relevant housing need ID for Brian and you can see this number here. It's always begins with an HN, and in this case it's 001414.  </p>
                    <p>The next thing that we must do in order to make sure that this record is attached to Brian's record is to go back to Brian's applicant page. And his household ID, so it will come back to here. You can see that the linked housing need remains empty. So, if you click once here, it will actually bring up the most recent record which we've been working on.</p>
                    <p>And if you click that will bring it into this box and then it's important that you again save and that will make sure that the housing need record is now attached to Brian through his household.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Whenever a household moves, it's necessary to create a new placement record and close any previous ones that were open. This helps us to create a history of the placements of where our individuals and households have been staying, including start and end dates and their reasons for moving.</p>
                    <p>To create a placement, we apply a placement against a household ID.  So we open either through the applicants table or through the household table and we come to where we can view the household ID records.</p>
                    <p>You'll see here that we have placement tracking. If you click placement tracking, this table enables us to add a new placement for this household group.</p>
                    <p>So click on the icon with the plus sign and you'll see that we do have some 'must fill' in columns, which are denoted by the red asterisk. So the first thing that we're going to do is to imagine that this household has just arrived at welcome centre. So we put them in the welcome centre and we get to say that their arrival date is today. We can put an allocated date if we wish to, but it's not necessary. </p>
                    <p>We must leave this date ended open at this point because otherwise that will close the placement tracking. </p>
                    <p>The next thing that we need to ensure we've completed is the local authority, which in this case will be Monmouthshire. And this is all that we need in order to start a new placement and so we click save.</p>
                    <p>And we can now see that the record has been created. And if we go back to the family ID, we can look in the placement tracking and we can see that we have a record here for the family or household under this code.</p>
                    <p>And if we want to look at the individuals, you can also see that placement tracking have been created for each person within the household as well. So if we go into the family ID, we can see the other person in the household here and we can view his record here.</p>
                    <p>He also has a placement tracking created, so doing this through the family ID means that that placement will be applied to all individuals within the system. </p>
                    <p>Now, if a family or a household then moves on and we need to close this tracking, this placement, then we can come into the system here, again ensuring that we're editing on the family's household ID.  And we click on the link to the record itself and we can now edit a few more aspects of the placement in order to close it. </p>
                    <p>So the first one we would do is the date.  So for example if we know that the family or the household are going to move moving on Friday, we can change the date then and we can also pick the move on reason which is 'moved on' so placement completed successfully, or it may be one of the other items, so for example they might move on to accommodate family reunion.  We’ll keep this one as placement completed successfully. And we will save this one and then we can go back.</p>
                    <p>So we can now see that the placement has both a start and an end date and a reason for the move on. And so that means that that placement is concluded.</p>
                    <p>Now if they are going to be moving to new accommodation, we can again start a new placement and it may be that they're moving to accommodation in a different local authority area.</p>
                    <p>So we may put them for example and move on accommodation that may start on Friday and again we can leave that date, end date open.  And we will look to move them to Rhondda Cynon Taf. </p>
                    <p>And the reason? It's not necessary yet because we haven't, we haven't changed anything other than establishing a new placement and crucially, by doing things in this order, by making sure that you close the old placement before starting the new.</p>
                    <p>This is important because if you work in a different local authority to the one where the new placement is taking place, you will no longer be able to see those records because of the information governance structures that we have in place.</p>
                    <p>So it's very important to make sure that you have everything that you need information wise before you transfer a person out of your local authority. So click save and then we are complete and you can now see this so it’s in order</p>
                    <p>Replacement is completed successfully in the welcome centre and they've now been put into move on accommodation.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>There are times when it's necessary to remove an individual from a household group for example because of relationship breakdown or because the group may not all be travelling together at the same time and therefore not all accommodated together.</p>
                    <p>There are three steps in doing this. </p>
                    <p>The first step is to remove the individual from the household group (the household under that household ID).</p>
                    <p>The second is to edit the housing needs, the linked housing needs record for the group that they are leaving,</p>
                    <p>and the third is to create a new linked housing need record for that individual if they're moving to a separate group on their own.</p>
                    <p>So the first step, under the Households menu, is to click on the family Household ID.  And as we can see we have this person here James Stephenson.</p>
                    <p>And for the purposes of this example, we're going to remove him from this group. So we use the action box and we click select and we have the three options there and remove applicant to a new household is our option.</p>
                    <p>It will only allow you to enter the names of people who are already in this group and there we can see James. And we'll say that he is being removed from this group as he's travelling separately. And our start date is today.</p>
                    <p>So after this day he won't be part of this household group, so you can save that. And this now means that he is no longer a member of this group. And so because he's no longer in the group, the next thing we need to do is to go and edit the linked housing need record.</p>
                    <p>So we click on the link. And as you can see, if we scroll down that there are requirements which are based upon James being a part of that group.</p>
                    <p>So we're going to edit this so that it's now just the three members of the group. So three confirmed family members, 3 adults, no children, and we're just going to take these details out which were relevant to James being a part of the group.</p>
                    <p>The number of bedrooms and beds are the same because he would have been sharing with the lead applicant in this scenario and so now that we've made those changes we can save and that means that James's housing requirements are no longer reflected under the household ID that he's been removed from.</p>
                    <p>If we go to the Applicants table, we can search for James. And here we can find him. So if we double click, this is James's single profile, and as you can see, his household ID is now WG code, and that means that he's been separated out from a previous household and that's why he has a WG code.</p>
                    <p>So if we click on that link this enables us then to create a new linked housing need for James. So if we click in the box here, we can come to the line that says new housing need and we can add that in.</p>
                    <p>So it's James that we're looking for and that automatically populates across to his household ID reference. And we can see that he's a single person. He's on the Super sponsor scheme. </p>
                    <p>We'll say that there's one person in the family, one adult, he's 40 and that he's male. One bedroom required and one bed. And he doesn't require any accessible property. He doesn't have any pets, and there are no other details that we need to capture within this housing needs section.</p>
                    <p>What you may wish to do here is to make a note of this household ID number. Because we have one final step which is to make sure that this housing record is attached to James's profile.</p>
                    <p>So we save this. And we go back to James. You can either use the back button, or you can simply click on James's name and this will take you back here. And if we click on his household ID code again, you can see that there's nothing in the link housing need here.</p>
                    <p>So if you click it will actually produce the number of the most recent one that we were working on. So you can add that, save and that will ensure that it's the correct details saved.</p>
                    <p>There we go. And so that's how you save that information.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>There may be circumstances when it's necessary to either add or remove a person to a household or to change the lead applicant of the group. This video explains that process.</p>
                    <p>It's vital that when adding or editing household groups, any housing requirements associated with those groups are also amended to reflect the change and if you change the lead applicant, you must reset the relationships between the applicants in the group.</p>
                    <p>So, this video is going to look at how you add an applicant to an existing household group.</p>
                    <p>So, the first thing we're going to do is go to our existing household group that we want to add an applicant into. So, if we click on the household ID, this will bring up our group. As you can see, we currently have three members of the group, and there are a group of friends who are travelling together.</p>
                    <p>What we're going to do is, again, use the action box that we've used previously to add an applicant, and we're going to search here for the name of the applicant that we're bringing into the family group.</p>
                    <p>So, in this case it's James Stephenson. And he's being added to the group. And he's being added because he has met a member of the existing group and he is now their partner and so they wish to travel together and to be accommodated together. So, we're going to save that change.</p>
                    <p>And as you can now see, we have a new person added to our household group. And so, it's necessary here to first make sure that we change the relationship so we can see that there's no relationship set yet for James. So, we can add that to, say, spouse or partner, and then we can save that change.</p>
                    <p>And the next thing we need to do, of course, is to edit our linked housing need record so that the needs of James are also reflected within that group. So, we're going to go to the linked housing need back at the top of the record, and we're going to click where there's a link in the name of the file. And this brings up the housing need record.</p>
                    <p>So, when we scroll down to the bottom of the page here, we can see the main requirements. We're now going to edit this so that it's four members of the group. It's 4 adults and we're going to edit this to show that we have an additional person who is 40 and male who has joined the group. And because he is a partner and is intending to share a room with Ashley, the lead applicant, there's no change to the number of bedrooms or beds required and he has no other requirements in terms of pets or any primary care or accessibility needs, so we can now save this record.</p>
                    <p>And this ensures that we have James's needs within the record for this household. And that ensures that the family group is up to date and that everybody is accounted for when we're looking to accommodate them later.</p>

                    <p>Making changes to household groups.</p>
                    <p>There may be circumstances when it's necessary to either add or remove a person to a household or to change the lead applicant of the group, and this video explains that process.</p>
                    <p>It's vital that whenever you edit a household group, you ensure that any housing requirements associated with that group is also amended to reflect the change.</p>
                    <p>And if you're changing a lead applicant, you must reset the relationships between the applicants in the group.</p>
                    <p>So to change a lead applicant we will use the households menu and if we select the household ID here, this will show all of the members of that household listed down here.</p>
                    <p>So if we want to change the lead applicant at the moment, we can see that it's Ashley Baker here because we have the yes. And it's also indicated in this field here that Ashley Baker is the lead applicant.</p>
                    <p>So to make any changes to a household group, we use this action box here. When you click select, you select the activity that you want to do. So select lead applicant, set lead applicant. And what we're going to do is pick one of the other people who are featured in the list. So we're going to change Laura Hill to become the lead applicant.</p>
                    <p>So we can start typing Nora's name here. And you can see that she's there and we can make a comment to say that we've changed Laura to lead applicant. And the date can be today. Now we can save here at the top. </p>
                    <p>And then when that’s saved, you'll be able to see that the lead applicant has now changed. And if we look down here, we can see that the relationships between the members of the group have also changed. </p>
                    <p>So now that Laura is the lead applicant, we don't need to set a relationship for her because she doesn't have a relationship to herself. But what we can do is edit Ashley and Katie's statuses so they are a group of friends travelling together. So we can change to friend here we can use either the Save button here or we can use the save button at the top.</p>
                    <p>And again, for Katie will also change that to friend, and we can save that to make sure that we've accounted for all of the differences involved in changing the lead applicant, and we can save and close.</p>
                    <p>And that has now changed, and you can see in the table here that Laura Hill is now the lead applicant of this household group.</p>

                <div class="transcript">
                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Within the data platform, it's possible to analyse and interrogate the data that you have using the report columns and filters.</p>
                    <p>So I'm going to show you in this video how you can use some of these functions so that you can narrow down the data that you hold. </p>
                    <p>So the example I'm going to use is that you want to be able to identify how many ‘under 18’ individuals you have within your data. So, the 1st way that we're going to do this, the first step is to use the edit filters button, and when we click this button, a pop-up appears which asks you to identify which bit of data you want to filter on.</p>
                    <p>So we click the add button here. And in this case, we're going to add a row. And we're going to select a field, and the fields are all of the different types of data that we hold within the system, and it's a huge list. If you know which title of the field you want to use, then you can start to type it in.</p>
                    <p>And so here you can see date of birth has started to come up and I can pick that from the system. And then what we're going to do is identify what we want the data to look like. So in this case, we want the data to be on or after. And what that means is that by using on or after, we're going to be able to filter our data to identify anyone born after 2004 and so today's date 2004, and that means that anybody after this date is under 18 years old.</p>
                    <p>So we'll start with that filter, and we always click Apply at the bottom here. And so what that does is that starts to narrow down the data to identify which individuals are under 18. And as you can see, if we scroll across to the birth dates, so date of birth, they're all after 2004.</p>
                    <p>In this case, we've got lots of jumbled up data, lots of different columns because we're using our All Applicants data. So now we can start to identify how we want to filter the data.  So for example, we might want to sort by last name. So that might be the easiest way. You can sort by A-Z or you may want to sort them by date of birth. So who's the oldest of that cohort and who's the youngest?</p>
                    <p>And so just by clicking on the top header of the column and picking here, you can sort them or you can also filter your columns here, so if you want to be very specific, you can also apply those additional filters to that column as well.</p>
                    <p>So in this case, we've sorted our data so that it's older to newer data. And that's the way that the data has been presented. And so you can see this is 2006 and 2007 and running all the way down to 2020. </p>
                    <p>Now you may want to narrow the data further, and so we may have some columns here that you might want to change so for example we can change the data here. So here's a filter so we might just want to see which under 18’s there are within the Super Sponsor Scheme and so we can click the button there and just make sure again that you click Apply.</p>
                    <p>And again that will now narrow down all of our under 18’s that we have within the data that are on these super sponsor route. Now if we want to change the layout of this view then what we can do is edit our columns.</p>
                    <p>So we may want to move some columns maybe. What you can do here if you want to move a particular column so the unique application number for example, you could either remove it using this button, or you could move it down because it's at the top. Or if you just simply want to drag, you can grab it and you can move it down. You can move it wherever you want to. </p>
                    <p>And similarly you can move other buttons up. And you can change all sorts of information about that group and the way that it's laid out.</p>
                    <p>You can also add additional columns here. And these are all of the fields again that are available that you can bring in so that you can formulate your view.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you make a change in this pop-up box, you need to make sure that you press Apply. And then you can begin to see that the layout of our data is different.</p>
                    <p>We have the ISS journey status, which isn't necessary. So actually, what we can do, we can take that one out and we can remove that one. Click Apply. </p>
                    <p>And as the data updates, you can see there that we now just have more relevant information to the Super Sponsor route.</p>
                    <p>So you'll see that as I've made changes to this information, which is all just based on the All Applicants data, you can see that there's a star against the title of the view and that's because it's not saved view, it's just a temporary view.</p>
                    <p>Now if you want to create this and keep this as a as a view on your system, you can come to the menu here the three dots and you can create views. So if you click the small arrow you have the option to save as a new view. And here you can change your titles so you can call it under 18 applicants.</p>
                    <p>And if you choose to, you can put a description in, but it's not necessary and so when I save I now have created a view which is now saved in the system and as you can see it appears here and this is my view and it's now within my list of views on the system because I've saved it.</p>

                <li>Notes (this should not contain any medical or sensitive information)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What information will not be available via the Data Platform?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Medical data</li>
                <li>Ongoing service provision (e.g schools, social care)</li>
                <li>Capacity of welcome centres</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How are service incidents relating to the Data Platform handled?</h3>
            <p>A <a href="support-model.html">support model</a> has been developed and agreed with colleagues from Digital Health and Care Wales. User incidents will be triaged by your organisation’s local service desk in the first instance, before a call is routed to the Data Platform service desk.</p>
            <h3>Has the Data Platform undergone accessibility testing?</h3>
            <p>Accessibility specialists have assessed the visual and functional accessibility of the Data Platform and provided advice to the development team on issues that needed to be addressed. All identified issues have been remediated in subsequent iterations of the Data Platform. Further testing with assistive technology users is planned for beta phase.</p>
            <h3>Will the Data Platform be bilingual?</h3>
            <p>The Data Platform is being developed to be fully bilingual and the user interface will be operable in both Welsh and English languages, although not at the point of initial release. Translation of content and Welsh Language user testing are built into the development roadmap.</p>
            <p>A current challenge that we are facing is Microsoft’s lack of a Welsh language pack for its PowerApps platform. We are working with Welsh Government’s Welsh Language Division to explore alternative component options and considering the security implications of some third-party products.</p>
            <h3>Will data continue to be provided via Objective Connect once the Data Platform goes live?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Data sharing via both channels will run in parallel for a period of time post-launch. The duration of which is yet to be defined and will depend on several factors, including user confidence with the new system.</p>
            <p>Data not available via the Platform, will continue to be shared via Objective Connect.</p>
            <h3>Will there be a mechanism for exporting data? </h3>
            <p>Users will be able to download / export data from the data platform into csv / xls formats. However, some of the data fields and the order they appear in may differ to those currently provided via Objective Connect. Examples of the format and layout of data exports will be provided shortly.</p>
            <h3 class="nonbold">Is data sharing via the Platform already covered by the <a href="http://www.waspi.org/participating-organisations">Wales Accord on the Sharing of Personal Information</a> (WASPI)?</h3>
            <p>WASPI framework data sharing agreements are in place with all Local Authorities and Health Boards, and we will use it in the preparation of a new Information Sharing Protocol that will be put in place for the platform in due course.</p>
            <h3>Who is the Data Controller for the data?</h3>
            <p>Welsh Government along with Local Authorities and Health Boards are all independent data controllers.</p>
            <h3>Has a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) been carried out?</h3>
            <p>As a data controller Welsh Government is in the process of carrying out a DPIA to help us identify and minimise any data protection risks.</p>
            <p>The DPIA will cover the processing of the personal data, rather than the actual system. However, the DPIA will reference how the Data Platform will prevent unauthorised or inappropriate access to the data.</p>
            <h3>Do Local Authorities and Local Health Boards need to carry out their own Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)?</h3>
            <p>As independent data controllers, it will be for local authorities and local health boards to determine whether they need their own DPIAs. The Welsh Government DPIA can be shared for information if that would be helpful.</p>
            <h3>Are new data sharing agreements required?</h3>
            <p>Data Disclosure Agreements (DDAs) are already in place between Welsh Government and local authorities/local health boards to enable the sharing of data to support Ukrainian citizens.</p>
            <p>Work is underway to develop a comprehensive Information Sharing Protocol, to cover the data platform and all Ukraine related data flows between the Welsh Government, local authorities, and the NHS. If you are interested in supporting this work, please email <a href="mailto:data@gov.wales">data@gov.wales</a></p>
            <h3>Do Local Authorities and Health Boards require a joint Data Sharing Agreement?</h3>
            <p>If local authorities and local health boards determine they are joint data controllers they are required to have a transparent arrangement that sets out their agreed roles and responsibilities for complying with the UK GDPR.</p>
            <p>However, if it is determined that they are processing the same data for different purposes they are not classed as joint controllers and no joint agreement is required.</p>
            <h3>Are there any data processors?</h3>
            <p>Digital Health and Care Wales and the Contact Centre are all data processors. Welcome Centre locations may also be data processors, but this is determined by the Local Authority for that location.</p>
            <h3>Are there agreements in place with the data processors?</h3>
            <p>There is already an agreement in place between Welsh Government and the contact centre. This will be reviewed and updated, if necessary, to ensure the data being processed once the Data Platform is operational is fully covered.</p>
            <p>A Memorandum of Understanding and GDPR schedule between Welsh Government and Digital Health and Care Wales has been agreed and signed by both parties.</p>
            <p>Local Authorities are responsible for arrangements with their respective welcome centres.</p>
            <h3>Are new privacy notices required?</h3>
            <p>Welsh Government will review our existing privacy notice with regards to this data to ensure it is up to date and accurate. If necessary, it will be updated as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>All data controllers and processors are advised to consider whether they also have appropriate privacy notices in place.</p>
            <h3>Has the Information Commissioner’s Office been engaged on this work?</h3>
            <p>We have informally engaged with the ICO’s office in Wales and they are supportive of the development of a data platform. Due to the nature of this data sharing, the Information Commissioner’s Office has not been formally consulted. The introduction of the Data Platform will not change this but will simplify and improve access to the data already being shared.</p>
