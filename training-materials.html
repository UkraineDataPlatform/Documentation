                    <p>To search for record, there are two ways to search on the system.</p>
                    <p>The first is to use the box, the search box here, which gives you search results based on whichever section of the system you're in.</p>
                    <p>So, if we put in the surname Jones here and you can either press enter or click on the magnifying glass that will return all of the results of people with the surname Jones under the Applicant section of the system.</p>
                    <p>If you want to do a wider search of the whole system, you can click the magnifying glass in the top menu, and again we type in the surname Jones, and this will return wider search results which include both sponsors and applicants to the scheme.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>As individuals on the Super Sponsor and Individual Sponsorship schemes move through our systems, it'll be necessary to change their journey status codes to reflect their progress.</p>
                    <p>So we can change that for both individual records, and we can also do that through the household ID to edit the records at the same time of all of the members of the household.</p>
                    <p>So to edit one person's record, so in this case Carol's record, we come to the SS journey status and we click the dropdown and once you're ready to change their status, you simply click the next status on the list and save.</p>
                    <p>And that has now applied that status change to Carol's record.</p>
                    <p>Now if we click on the household ID, you can see that we have another member of the household and this person is also ready to move on and to change their journey status.</p>
                    <p>So in fact, if we wanted to change the records of everyone in the household group, we come to the table at the bottom of the screen and we click Select All.</p>
                    <p>And then where we have the Edit button, this enables us to edit the two records at the same time. So we go to the SS journey status, the same dropdown that we had for the individual screen, and we click SSO8, Ready for Move On, and we click Save.</p>
                    <p>And those two records have now been saved and that ensures that the whole household now all have the same status code and are ready for move on.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Some individuals coming through our schemes may have complex cases,and what we mean by complex cases is that they may have additional health or well-being concerns or safeguarding concerns which local authorities need to be aware of due to the nature of the system not being designed to handle sensitive information.</p>
                    <p>It's important to have a means of flagging complex cases on this system and ensuring that anyone handling that case can refer to local information and local files for further details on the complexity and the nature of those cases</p>
                    <p>So to add a complex case note, we come to an individual's record. So we'll use Rachel in this case.</p>
                    <p>On Rachel's record, we're going to first add a 'Yes' at the top here to indicate that shehas complex case and we're going to also enter a note to say. Complex Case and with that we can say,"please speak to N Jones for further information".</p>
                    <p>And that just means that we can flag who the person is that has the information or that is the best person to speak to for further details on this case.</p>
                    <p>So when we save,that note is added under complex case and you can see that the flag here is yes. If we then come out of the record, when you go back into Rachel's record in future, if you double click, you're instantly shown that there is a complex case flag on this system.</p>
                    <p>So that means that nobody can access this record without being aware that this is a complex case and that they need to refer to local case notes for further information to provide the right support available.</p>

                <div class="transcript">
                    <p>The platform has been developed to enable you to capture where checks and appointments have been undertaken on the system and also to add any case notes and activities which identify actions that have taken place to support that person.</p>
                    <p>If we have a look on Joanna's record here, you can see that we have a box on the right-hand side for individual sponsor applicant checks and these are checks that are specific to people who are on the individual sponsorship route.</p>
                    <p>So when you as a local authority have undertaken a particular action, you can change this toggle box here in order to make sure that you capture that the action has taken place.  So in this case, we could say that a welfare visit has been completed and then interim payment of £200 has been made.</p>
                    <p>We can change those toggles to yes and click save and that ensures that that record has been updated.  We can also do this for multiple individuals as well.  So if we were to search in the system for a family group and we can look at this particular household.</p>
                    <p>So the lead contact, the lead applicant is Stephen and we can see that we have some checks here that are relative to the Super Sponsor Scheme. You can undertake these checks individually for each person within the household or you can actually update the checks at the same time for both members of the household.</p>
                    <p>As you can see we have both Stephen and Alexandra.  To update sponsor super applicants or individual sponsor applicant checks at the same time, whichever scheme they're on, a tab is available here which enables you to update their actions at the same time.</p>
                    <p>So if we wanted to say that both Alexandra and Stephen have had their medical screening. We can use this tab and this box in order to quickly update their records and we can either use the save button at the top here or the tiny little disc save button on the right-hand side here. And that has updated their records so that if we went back to look at their individual records you would now be able to see on Stephen's individual record that that welcome centre medical screening button has changed to a yes.</p>
                    <p>And if we were to go and look at his relative, Alexandra's record here, which we can use this navigate button to do, we can also see that she has had this button changed to a yes,  so that's a means of changing the checks for multiple members of a household at the same time.</p>
                    <p>One other check that it's important to show you is around sponsors.  For example, if we have a sponsor who has a household, so who has other members of their household that need to complete a DBS check, such as these sponsor checks over here, we would only change these toggles when we’re satisfied that ALL members of the household that require a DBS check and have them completed.   So not just the sponsor but any members of the household.</p>
                    <p>And once you're satisfied that those checks have been completed for all sponsor household members that need them, then you can change that tab. And you can save that as well and that's a record that you've completed that note. </p>
                    <p>All the while we've got case notes and activities here, and you can simply add a note here to say checks have been undertaken.  And you can add further notes in to say that the DBS check was done for all relevant members of the family.</p>
                    <p>By adding notes into this section, it ensures that the next person in your team that comes along can see the activities that have taken place in relation to those checks, or indeed to anything else that you feel is important to add onto a person's record.</p>
                    <p>There are many different notes that you may wish to capture, particularly where, for example, you may have a person who has a complex case.  A complex case is, as referred to in the other video, where somebody might have a particular health or medical requirement or a sensitive case that that we require some sensitive handling and so those can also be added in the case notes here and press save.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="transcript">
                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Housing need records reflects the type of housing and accommodations that an individual or family may need when they move to Wales. In order to understand the requirements that they have, we create a housing need record which captures the information on the types of bedrooms, number of rooms, number of beds, whether they have pets, and any additional accessibility requirements that they have so that they can be provided appropriate accommodation when they arrive.</p>
                    <p>The people that are arriving on the individual sponsor scheme will need their housing needs to be updated by the local authority, and so I'll show you how to do that now.</p>
                    <p>So we're going to pick under the Household section or the Applicant section. You can search for an individual as I'm just going to search by a person's name and that person is called Brian.</p>
                    <p>And as we can see here, Brian has come up in the active households table. They have a Household ID, but they do not have a housing need yet and so we need to create that. So if you click double click here in the family ID line and you can see that housing need is not attached.</p>
                    <p>So the first thing we're going to do is click with the left button of your mouse in this box and you can see here that we have the ability to create a new housing need. So click on this link. And when this opens, it will lead us to a blank housing need record that we can now create.</p>
                    <p>So if you click in the first box for Applicant, you can see that Brian is the first person that we've been most recently dealing with and his record is at the top.</p>
                    <p>So we can click Brian and that immediately populates his household ID as well. Now we know that Brian is a single person who's a household of 1, so that will require single in this box. He's also travelling on the individual sponsor scheme and so we can update that as well.</p>
                    <p>You'll notice that it's only the fields that have a red asterisk which need to be created, which need to be completed, but you can complete other data if you have it as well and if it's useful to you.</p>
                    <p>As we scroll down the page, you can see the main requirements and we can start to fit in here any information that we know about Brian and his requirements. So we know that it's a one person family and it's one adult. There are no children and Brian is 45, and he is male, so we'll put an M in this box. He's going to require one bedroom and one bed, and then we can start picking if there are any other aspects that he needs.</p>
                    <p>So for example, he doesn't need a wheelchair or accessible property. So we'll keep this as no, he doesn't have any pets and he doesn't have any of the aspects of this form that we need to complete.  But you can do if it's relevant to the individual whose form you're completing.</p>
                    <p>So this if we click save will create a household ID and a relevant housing need ID for Brian and you can see this number here. It's always begins with an HN, and in this case it's 001414.  </p>
                    <p>The next thing that we must do in order to make sure that this record is attached to Brian's record is to go back to Brian's applicant page. And his household ID, so it will come back to here. You can see that the linked housing need remains empty. So, if you click once here, it will actually bring up the most recent record which we've been working on.</p>
                    <p>And if you click that will bring it into this box and then it's important that you again save and that will make sure that the housing need record is now attached to Brian through his household.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Whenever a household moves, it's necessary to create a new placement record and close any previous ones that were open. This helps us to create a history of the placements of where our individuals and households have been staying, including start and end dates and their reasons for moving.</p>
                    <p>To create a placement, we apply a placement against a household ID.  So we open either through the applicants table or through the household table and we come to where we can view the household ID records.</p>
                    <p>You'll see here that we have placement tracking. If you click placement tracking, this table enables us to add a new placement for this household group.</p>
                    <p>So click on the icon with the plus sign and you'll see that we do have some 'must fill' in columns, which are denoted by the red asterisk. So the first thing that we're going to do is to imagine that this household has just arrived at welcome centre. So we put them in the welcome centre and we get to say that their arrival date is today. We can put an allocated date if we wish to, but it's not necessary. </p>
                    <p>We must leave this date ended open at this point because otherwise that will close the placement tracking. </p>
                    <p>The next thing that we need to ensure we've completed is the local authority, which in this case will be Monmouthshire. And this is all that we need in order to start a new placement and so we click save.</p>
                    <p>And we can now see that the record has been created. And if we go back to the family ID, we can look in the placement tracking and we can see that we have a record here for the family or household under this code.</p>
                    <p>And if we want to look at the individuals, you can also see that placement tracking have been created for each person within the household as well. So if we go into the family ID, we can see the other person in the household here and we can view his record here.</p>
                    <p>He also has a placement tracking created, so doing this through the family ID means that that placement will be applied to all individuals within the system. </p>
                    <p>Now, if a family or a household then moves on and we need to close this tracking, this placement, then we can come into the system here, again ensuring that we're editing on the family's household ID.  And we click on the link to the record itself and we can now edit a few more aspects of the placement in order to close it. </p>
                    <p>So the first one we would do is the date.  So for example if we know that the family or the household are going to move moving on Friday, we can change the date then and we can also pick the move on reason which is 'moved on' so placement completed successfully, or it may be one of the other items, so for example they might move on to accommodate family reunion.  We’ll keep this one as placement completed successfully. And we will save this one and then we can go back.</p>
                    <p>So we can now see that the placement has both a start and an end date and a reason for the move on. And so that means that that placement is concluded.</p>
                    <p>Now if they are going to be moving to new accommodation, we can again start a new placement and it may be that they're moving to accommodation in a different local authority area.</p>
                    <p>So we may put them for example and move on accommodation that may start on Friday and again we can leave that date, end date open.  And we will look to move them to Rhondda Cynon Taf. </p>
                    <p>And the reason? It's not necessary yet because we haven't, we haven't changed anything other than establishing a new placement and crucially, by doing things in this order, by making sure that you close the old placement before starting the new.</p>
                    <p>This is important because if you work in a different local authority to the one where the new placement is taking place, you will no longer be able to see those records because of the information governance structures that we have in place.</p>
                    <p>So it's very important to make sure that you have everything that you need information wise before you transfer a person out of your local authority. So click save and then we are complete and you can now see this so it’s in order</p>
                    <p>Replacement is completed successfully in the welcome centre and they've now been put into move on accommodation.</p>

                <div class="transcript">
                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>There are times when it's necessary to remove an individual from a household group for example because of relationship breakdown or because the group may not all be travelling together at the same time and therefore not all accommodated together.</p>
                    <p>There are three steps in doing this. </p>
                    <p>The first step is to remove the individual from the household group (the household under that household ID).</p>
                    <p>The second is to edit the housing needs, the linked housing needs record for the group that they are leaving,</p>
                    <p>and the third is to create a new linked housing need record for that individual if they're moving to a separate group on their own.</p>
                    <p>So the first step, under the Households menu, is to click on the family Household ID.  And as we can see we have this person here James Stephenson.</p>
                    <p>And for the purposes of this example, we're going to remove him from this group. So we use the action box and we click select and we have the three options there and remove applicant to a new household is our option.</p>
                    <p>It will only allow you to enter the names of people who are already in this group and there we can see James. And we'll say that he is being removed from this group as he's travelling separately. And our start date is today.</p>
                    <p>So after this day he won't be part of this household group, so you can save that. And this now means that he is no longer a member of this group. And so because he's no longer in the group, the next thing we need to do is to go and edit the linked housing need record.</p>
                    <p>So we click on the link. And as you can see, if we scroll down that there are requirements which are based upon James being a part of that group.</p>
                    <p>So we're going to edit this so that it's now just the three members of the group. So three confirmed family members, 3 adults, no children, and we're just going to take these details out which were relevant to James being a part of the group.</p>
                    <p>The number of bedrooms and beds are the same because he would have been sharing with the lead applicant in this scenario and so now that we've made those changes we can save and that means that James's housing requirements are no longer reflected under the household ID that he's been removed from.</p>
                    <p>If we go to the Applicants table, we can search for James. And here we can find him. So if we double click, this is James's single profile, and as you can see, his household ID is now WG code, and that means that he's been separated out from a previous household and that's why he has a WG code.</p>
                    <p>So if we click on that link this enables us then to create a new linked housing need for James. So if we click in the box here, we can come to the line that says new housing need and we can add that in.</p>
                    <p>So it's James that we're looking for and that automatically populates across to his household ID reference. And we can see that he's a single person. He's on the Super sponsor scheme. </p>
                    <p>We'll say that there's one person in the family, one adult, he's 40 and that he's male. One bedroom required and one bed. And he doesn't require any accessible property. He doesn't have any pets, and there are no other details that we need to capture within this housing needs section.</p>
                    <p>What you may wish to do here is to make a note of this household ID number. Because we have one final step which is to make sure that this housing record is attached to James's profile.</p>
                    <p>So we save this. And we go back to James. You can either use the back button, or you can simply click on James's name and this will take you back here. And if we click on his household ID code again, you can see that there's nothing in the link housing need here.</p>
                    <p>So if you click it will actually produce the number of the most recent one that we were working on. So you can add that, save and that will ensure that it's the correct details saved.</p>
                    <p>There we go. And so that's how you save that information.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>There may be circumstances when it's necessary to either add or remove a person to a household or to change the lead applicant of the group. This video explains that process.</p>
                    <p>It's vital that when adding or editing household groups, any housing requirements associated with those groups are also amended to reflect the change and if you change the lead applicant, you must reset the relationships between the applicants in the group.</p>
                    <p>So, this video is going to look at how you add an applicant to an existing household group.</p>
                    <p>So, the first thing we're going to do is go to our existing household group that we want to add an applicant into. So, if we click on the household ID, this will bring up our group. As you can see, we currently have three members of the group, and there are a group of friends who are travelling together.</p>
                    <p>What we're going to do is, again, use the action box that we've used previously to add an applicant, and we're going to search here for the name of the applicant that we're bringing into the family group.</p>
                    <p>So, in this case it's James Stephenson. And he's being added to the group. And he's being added because he has met a member of the existing group and he is now their partner and so they wish to travel together and to be accommodated together. So, we're going to save that change.</p>
                    <p>And as you can now see, we have a new person added to our household group. And so, it's necessary here to first make sure that we change the relationship so we can see that there's no relationship set yet for James. So, we can add that to, say, spouse or partner, and then we can save that change.</p>
                    <p>And the next thing we need to do, of course, is to edit our linked housing need record so that the needs of James are also reflected within that group. So, we're going to go to the linked housing need back at the top of the record, and we're going to click where there's a link in the name of the file. And this brings up the housing need record.</p>
                    <p>So, when we scroll down to the bottom of the page here, we can see the main requirements. We're now going to edit this so that it's four members of the group. It's 4 adults and we're going to edit this to show that we have an additional person who is 40 and male who has joined the group. And because he is a partner and is intending to share a room with Ashley, the lead applicant, there's no change to the number of bedrooms or beds required and he has no other requirements in terms of pets or any primary care or accessibility needs, so we can now save this record.</p>
                    <p>And this ensures that we have James's needs within the record for this household. And that ensures that the family group is up to date and that everybody is accounted for when we're looking to accommodate them later.</p>

                    <p>Making changes to household groups.</p>
                    <p>There may be circumstances when it's necessary to either add or remove a person to a household or to change the lead applicant of the group, and this video explains that process.</p>
                    <p>It's vital that whenever you edit a household group, you ensure that any housing requirements associated with that group is also amended to reflect the change.</p>
                    <p>And if you're changing a lead applicant, you must reset the relationships between the applicants in the group.</p>
                    <p>So to change a lead applicant we will use the households menu and if we select the household ID here, this will show all of the members of that household listed down here.</p>
                    <p>So if we want to change the lead applicant at the moment, we can see that it's Ashley Baker here because we have the yes. And it's also indicated in this field here that Ashley Baker is the lead applicant.</p>
                    <p>So to make any changes to a household group, we use this action box here. When you click select, you select the activity that you want to do. So select lead applicant, set lead applicant. And what we're going to do is pick one of the other people who are featured in the list. So we're going to change Laura Hill to become the lead applicant.</p>
                    <p>So we can start typing Nora's name here. And you can see that she's there and we can make a comment to say that we've changed Laura to lead applicant. And the date can be today. Now we can save here at the top. </p>
                    <p>And then when that’s saved, you'll be able to see that the lead applicant has now changed. And if we look down here, we can see that the relationships between the members of the group have also changed. </p>
                    <p>So now that Laura is the lead applicant, we don't need to set a relationship for her because she doesn't have a relationship to herself. But what we can do is edit Ashley and Katie's statuses so they are a group of friends travelling together. So we can change to friend here we can use either the Save button here or we can use the save button at the top.</p>
                    <p>And again, for Katie will also change that to friend, and we can save that to make sure that we've accounted for all of the differences involved in changing the lead applicant, and we can save and close.</p>
                    <p>And that has now changed, and you can see in the table here that Laura Hill is now the lead applicant of this household group.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="transcript">
                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Within the data platform, it's possible to analyse and interrogate the data that you have using the report columns and filters.</p>
                    <p>So I'm going to show you in this video how you can use some of these functions so that you can narrow down the data that you hold. </p>
                    <p>So the example I'm going to use is that you want to be able to identify how many ‘under 18’ individuals you have within your data. So, the 1st way that we're going to do this, the first step is to use the edit filters button, and when we click this button, a pop-up appears which asks you to identify which bit of data you want to filter on.</p>
                    <p>So we click the add button here. And in this case, we're going to add a row. And we're going to select a field, and the fields are all of the different types of data that we hold within the system, and it's a huge list. If you know which title of the field you want to use, then you can start to type it in.</p>
                    <p>And so here you can see date of birth has started to come up and I can pick that from the system. And then what we're going to do is identify what we want the data to look like. So in this case, we want the data to be on or after. And what that means is that by using on or after, we're going to be able to filter our data to identify anyone born after 2004 and so today's date 2004, and that means that anybody after this date is under 18 years old.</p>
                    <p>So we'll start with that filter, and we always click Apply at the bottom here. And so what that does is that starts to narrow down the data to identify which individuals are under 18. And as you can see, if we scroll across to the birth dates, so date of birth, they're all after 2004.</p>
                    <p>In this case, we've got lots of jumbled up data, lots of different columns because we're using our All Applicants data. So now we can start to identify how we want to filter the data.  So for example, we might want to sort by last name. So that might be the easiest way. You can sort by A-Z or you may want to sort them by date of birth. So who's the oldest of that cohort and who's the youngest?</p>
                    <p>And so just by clicking on the top header of the column and picking here, you can sort them or you can also filter your columns here, so if you want to be very specific, you can also apply those additional filters to that column as well.</p>
                    <p>So in this case, we've sorted our data so that it's older to newer data. And that's the way that the data has been presented. And so you can see this is 2006 and 2007 and running all the way down to 2020. </p>
                    <p>Now you may want to narrow the data further, and so we may have some columns here that you might want to change so for example we can change the data here. So here's a filter so we might just want to see which under 18’s there are within the Super Sponsor Scheme and so we can click the button there and just make sure again that you click Apply.</p>
                    <p>And again that will now narrow down all of our under 18’s that we have within the data that are on these super sponsor route. Now if we want to change the layout of this view then what we can do is edit our columns.</p>
                    <p>So we may want to move some columns maybe. What you can do here if you want to move a particular column so the unique application number for example, you could either remove it using this button, or you could move it down because it's at the top. Or if you just simply want to drag, you can grab it and you can move it down. You can move it wherever you want to. </p>
                    <p>And similarly you can move other buttons up. And you can change all sorts of information about that group and the way that it's laid out.</p>
                    <p>You can also add additional columns here. And these are all of the fields again that are available that you can bring in so that you can formulate your view.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you make a change in this pop-up box, you need to make sure that you press Apply. And then you can begin to see that the layout of our data is different.</p>
                    <p>We have the ISS journey status, which isn't necessary. So actually, what we can do, we can take that one out and we can remove that one. Click Apply. </p>
                    <p>And as the data updates, you can see there that we now just have more relevant information to the Super Sponsor route.</p>
                    <p>So you'll see that as I've made changes to this information, which is all just based on the All Applicants data, you can see that there's a star against the title of the view and that's because it's not saved view, it's just a temporary view.</p>
                    <p>Now if you want to create this and keep this as a as a view on your system, you can come to the menu here the three dots and you can create views. So if you click the small arrow you have the option to save as a new view. And here you can change your titles so you can call it under 18 applicants.</p>
                    <p>And if you choose to, you can put a description in, but it's not necessary and so when I save I now have created a view which is now saved in the system and as you can see it appears here and this is my view and it's now within my list of views on the system because I've saved it.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>What is the purpose of the Data Platform?</h3>
            <p>The Data Platform facilitates secure access to an up to date, single source of data to those providing support to Ukrainian citizens coming into Wales.</p>
            <p>It helps provide an overview of all those entering Wales so that we can easily monitor and support individuals, as well as enable accurate reporting to Welsh Ministers and UK Government.</p>
            
            <h3>When was the Data Platform launched?</h3>
            <p>Welsh Government launched the Data Platform in June 2022. The platform continues to benefit from monthly functionality improvements based on end user feedback. </p>
            
            <h3>Who has access to the Data Platform?</h3>
            <p>The organisations who currently have access to the Data Platform are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Welsh Government</li>
                <li>Digital Health and Care Wales</li>
                <li>National Contact Centre</li>
                <li>Local Authorities in Wales</li>
                <li>Public Health Wales</li>
                <li>Local Health Boards in Wales</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What are Accommodations?</h3>
            <p>Accommodations refer to initial accommodation provided to individuals who are coming to Wales under the Welsh Government Super Sponsorship Scheme, and there are a number across Wales. Some of these are often referred to as ‘Welcome Centres’ – generally because they will be exclusively used by Ukrainian guests and offer on-site provision of services. Welcome Centres are run by the local authority in the area they are located.</p>
            
            <h3>What is meant by "Initial Accommodation Staff’"?</h3>
            <p>Local Authority employees who are running the Initial Accommodation sites / Welcome Centres in their areas. Non-Local Authority Staff employed by the Welcome Centres are not included in this category.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the difference between a Sponsor and a Host?</h3>
            <p><b>Sponsors:</b> those that are sponsoring the applicants’ visas. Dependent on the scheme this could be – Welsh Government (Super Sponsor Scheme) or an individual (Homes for Ukraine Individual Scheme). Once a Visa has been granted, the sponsor will never change. The sponsor is linked directly to the applicant/application. A sponsor is often also the initial host for the applicant but does need a separate record. Sponsor details can be updated but the link between the sponsor and applicant/application cannot.</p>
            <p><b>Hosts:</b> those providing accommodation for an applicant irrespective of Homes for Ukraine route. The host is based on where the applicant is currently housed (normally this will be with the sponsor initially). This is transient and the host and applicant are linked through the placement record.</p>
            <p>Host and sponsor details are recorded in the same section of the data platform but are classified as either sponsor or host. Sponsor information comes into the Platform through the data imported from UK Government.</p>
        
            <h3>Will Initial Accommodation (sometimes referred to as Welcome Centre) sites have access to the Data Platform?</h3>
            <p>Third parties providing Initial Accommodation provision do not have access to the system. Only staff working in local authorities who are managing the Initial Accommodation / Welcome Centres have access.</p>

            <h3>What information will be available via the Data Platform?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Names, addresses and other key demographic information for Ukrainians, hosts and sponsors.</li>
                <li>Checks required and whether they have been completed</li>
                <li>Accommodation requirements</li>
                <li>Notes (this should not contain any medical or sensitive information)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What information will not be available via the Data Platform?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Special Category Data (for example: Medical, political beliefs, sexual orientation, religious beliefs)</li>
                <li>Details of criminal offences/convictions (though we need to collect whether prospective hosts or sponsors have failed certain checks)</li>
                <li>Ongoing service provision (e.g. schools, social care)</li>
                <li>Capacity of Initial Accomodation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How are service incidents relating to the Data Platform handled?</h3>
            <p>User incidents are triaged by your organisation’s local service desk in the first instance, before a call is routed to the Data Platform service desk. Refer to the <a href="support-model.html">support model</a> for detailed information.</p>
            
            <h3>I have a query relating to how you use the Ukraine Data Platform, who should I contact?</h3>
            <p>If you have a query relating to how you use the Ukraine Data Platform please:

            <p>Due to the breadth of queries that we receive through the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a> mailbox, we will be prioritising messages relating to a technical issue or where the answer to a question isn’t available on this site.</p>    

            <h3>How do we know when there has been an update to the platform?</h3>
            <p>New bug fixes and changes to the Live system are communicated via release notes. These are sent via email prior to or on the day of update to all data champions, however we try to communicate these changes in advance through the data champion community drop-in sessions. </p>

            <h3>Is there a centralised place to access user guides and updates?</h3>
            <p>This site contains access to all training documents, user guides and other UDP based information.</p>
            <p>You can access this direct from within the UDP by clicking the ‘?’ icon at the top righthand side of the application window.</p>
            <p>We have tried to make the user guide easier to navigate on the site and have added our new ‘bite size’ training videos to help with key aspects of using the platform. You can also find previous versions of our Newsletter and other helpful information on system updates.</p>

            <h3>I am unable to locate an applicant on the system.</h3>
            <p>If the applicant has had their visa approved but you cannot locate them on the system, their record may be assigned to another Local Authority. </p>
            <p>An ‘out of area search’ function is available to enable you to find basic information about any record within the platform, regardless of which local authority the record is assigned to.</p>
            <p>Find out how to use it at <a href="https://ukrainedataplatform.github.io/documentation/user-guide.html#searching-record-outside">Searching for a record outside of your local authority.</a></p>
            <p>If you still cannot locate the applicant in the system, please contact us through the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a> and copy in <a href="mailto:data@gov.wales">data@gov.wales</a>data@gov.wales mailbox to seek further assistance.</p>

            <h3>I don’t feel confident using the system and would like more training, is this available?</h3>
            <p>We hope that the <a href="https://ukrainedataplatform.github.io/documentation/user-guide.html">User Guide</a> will contain everything you need to work your way through the platform. You are also able to watch the recorded training sessions for Local Authorities or Local Health Boards.  We also have bite size videos that supply focused guidance on specific tasks within the Data Platform.</p>
            <p>They can all be accessed under <a href="https://ukrainedataplatform.github.io/documentation/training-materials.html">Training Materials</a>.</p>
            <p>Do you still want more training? If so, which processes should we focus on?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Could we develop any other functionality to aid you in managing your records?</li>
                <li>Are there any other barriers affecting your ability to use the data platform for your day-to-day tasks?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please email <a href="mailto:mark.patterson@gov.wales">mark.patterson@gov.wales</a> with your comments.</p>

            <h3>Why am I asked to keep my records up to date?</h3>
            <p>The platform is designed to show the true picture of how we are supporting all Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in Wales. You and your colleagues in local authorities and local health boards all rely on access to accurate records relating to the individuals you are responsible for. Keeping records in the platform up to date is important because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The data within the platform is used to report to the UK Government every quarter.</li>
                <li>Incorrect data could result in incorrect funding for the services you have provided.</li>
                <li>Multiple stakeholders are drawing information from the platform to inform future policy decisions. If the data is not correct, this may have a negative effect on decision making.</li>
                <li>Health boards will primarily use the system to trace people who they have lost contact with and for identifying provision and direct of future support. Healthcare services and individual patient outcomes could be affected if records are not up to date.</li>
                <li>We need it to be up to date to ensure we are communicating with all hosts in Wales, and not just those who acted as sponsors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is imperative that everyone using the platform ensures their records are up to date, accurate and assigned to the correct local authority.</p>

            <h3>How can I ensure that I keep all my records up to date?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure every household/applicant has a placement record that reflects where they have stayed in Wales. This may be one or more records. Placement records are used to calculate how long guests have either been in host accommodations or initial accommodation</li>
                <li>Complete all household/applicant checks to ensure local support services have been accessed.</li>
                <li>Ensure all host contact information is available on their record.</li>
                <li>Complete suitability checks on all sponsors/hosts and any relevant members of their own household and their accommodation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Are WG doing anything to support LAs to keep their records up to date?</h3>
            <p>We have developed a new system view in the platform which will show applicant records that do not have an active placement record. We hope this will help you to target your efforts in completing this information and fulfilling your data management responsibilities under GDPR. In addition, the existing user guide shows you how to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete Welcome Centre Checks for new arrivals</li>
                <li>Follow the steps to manage new arrivals on the Super Sponsor route and the Individual Sponsor route</li>
                <li>Open and close placement records</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also attend one of our bi-weekly drop-in sessions, send us an email or contact your fellow platform users. Contact us if you do not have the ‘platform user community’ contact list. </p>

            <h3>As a data champion, how often should I use and access the platform?</h3>
            <p>There is an expectation for data champions and other Local Authority users to frequently access the data platform. This ensures that data is monitored correctly and kept up to date. Failure to access the system on a regular basis can result in a back log of up-to-date records. </p>

            <h3>What is a data champion and what are their roles and responsibilities?</h3>
            <p>Data Champions play a key role in ensuring the Data Platform is actively and effectively used within their organisations. Due to the sensitive nature of the data held on the platform, Champions are also gatekeepers within their organisation, ensuring access is only provided to those that need it.</p>
            <p>Data Champions have the same access to the platform as other local users but have a deeper understanding of the system, enabling them to provide advice and training to colleagues.</p>
            <p>Data Champion responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Determining who requires access to the Data Platform within their organisation and submitting requests as required.</li>
                <li>Nominating and validating requests for new local Champions, using the template provided.</li>
                <li>Championing the use and best practice of the Ukraine Data Platform.</li>
                <li>Providing training and guidance to new users within their organisation.</li>
                <li>Act as contact point between users within their organisation and the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a> mailbox Mailbox.</li>
                <li>Attend drop-in sessions to exchange information on the Data Platform’s current releases.</li>
                <li>Feedback suggestions for improvements and changes in Data Platform functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How do I nominate a new / remove a data champion?</h3>
            <p>To make a request to add / remove a data champion (or any user) you will need to contact the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a> Mailbox.  This request should always come from an existing data champion within your authority.</p>
            <p>When sending the Data Platform team your nomination for a new local Data Champion, please use the following form of words in your email:</p>
            <p>"I can confirm that I have trained [new Champion’s full name] on how to use the Data Platform and that they have access to the User Guide to support their on-going use of the system. Please register them as a Data Champion for [name of organisation]."</p>

            <h3>How often should users access the platform?</h3>
            <p>If a user doesn’t access the data platform for more than 30 days they will be flagged as inactive and their account will be disabled. </p>

            <h3>Has the Data Platform undergone accessibility testing?</h3>
            <p>Accessibility specialists assessed the visual and functional accessibility of the Data Platform and provided advice to the development team on identified issues. All identified issues have been remediated.</p>
           
            <h3>Will the Data Platform be bilingual?</h3>
            <p>The Data Platform is currently not bilingual as there is not a Welsh language pack for the development tool. We continue to explore cost effective ways to achieve a bilingual solution.</p>

            
            <h3>Will data continue to be provided via Objective Connect once the Data Platform goes live?</h3>
            <p>Objective Connect is now switched off for many of the Ukraine Data feeds. Data is now available through system views and Excel templates within the Ukraine Data Platform.</p>
            
            <h3>Is there a mechanism for exporting data?</h3>
            <p>Users can download / export data from the data platform into csv / xls formats.</p>
            
            <h3 class="nonbold">Is data sharing via the Platform already covered by the <a href="http://www.waspi.org/participating-organisations">Wales Accord on the Sharing of Personal Information</a> (WASPI)?</h3>
            <p>A WASPI assured Information Sharing Protocol is available to cover all data sharing and has been issued to all Local Authorities and Health Boards for sign off. </p>
            
            <h3>Who is the Data Controller for the data?</h3>
            <p>Welsh Government along with Local Authorities and Health Boards are all independent data controllers.</p>
           
            <h3>Has a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) been carried out?</h3>
            <p>As a data controller Welsh Government has conducted a DPIA to help us identify and minimise any data protection risks.</p>
            <p>The DPIA covers the processing of the personal data, rather than the actual system. However, the DPIA references how the Data Platform prevents unauthorised or inappropriate access to the data.</p>
            <p>The DPIA is kept under regular review to ensure it continues to reflect the situation and any changes in data flows.</p>
            
            <h3>Do Local Authorities and Local Health Boards need to carry out their own Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)?</h3>
            <p>As independent data controllers, it will be for local authorities and local health boards to determine whether they need their own DPIAs. The Welsh Government DPIA has been shared with all partners and may be used as a guide if appropriate.</p>
            
            <h3>Are new data sharing agreements required?</h3>
            <p>A comprehensive Information Sharing Protocol (ISP), covering the data platform and all Ukraine related data flows between the Welsh Government, local authorities, and the NHS has been developed and formally assured by WASPI. The majority of partners have signed and returned the agreement – if you are unsure whether your organisation has signed the ISP we recommend contacting your Data Champion or Data Protection Officer in the first instance. Subsequently, if you are still unsure please contact <a href="mailto:data@gov.wales">data@gov.wales</a> with the subject line ‘Ukraine ISP’.</p>
         
            
            <h3>Do Local Authorities and Health Boards require a joint Data Sharing Agreement?</h3>
            <p>If local authorities and local health boards determine they are joint data controllers they are required to have a transparent arrangement that sets out their agreed roles and responsibilities for complying with the UK GDPR.</p>
            <p>However, if it is determined that they are processing the same data for different purposes they are not classed as joint controllers and no joint agreement is required.</p>
            
            <h3>Are there any data processors?</h3>
            <p>Digital Health and Care Wales and the Contact Centre are all data processors. Welcome Centre locations may also be data processors, but this is determined by the Local Authority for that location.</p>
            
            <h3>Are there agreements in place with the data processors?</h3>
            <p>There is already an agreement in place between Welsh Government and the contact centre. This will be reviewed and updated, if necessary, to ensure the data being processed on the Data Platform is fully covered.</p>
            <p>A Memorandum of Understanding and GDPR schedule between Welsh Government and Digital Health and Care Wales has been agreed and signed by both parties. This agreement will be reviewed to unsure it is kept up to date and reflects the current data sharing arrangements.</p>
            <p>Local Authorities are responsible for arrangements with their respective processors, including welcome centres, if required. </p>
            
            <h3>Are new privacy notices required?</h3>
            <p>Welsh Government will regularly review our existing privacy notices with regards to this data to ensure it is up to date and accurate. </p>
            <p>All data controllers and processors are advised to consider whether they need specific Ukraine related privacy notices in place to reflect the operational functions being carried out by their individual organisations. </p>
            
            <h3>Has the Information Commissioner’s Office been engaged on this work?</h3>
            <p>We informally engaged with the ICO’s office in Wales during the development of the data platform and they were supportive of the initiative. Due to the nature of this data sharing, the Information Commissioner’s Office has not been formally consulted. The introduction of the Data Platform will not change but will simplify and improve access to the data already being shared.</p>

            <h2>Policy FAQs</h2>

            <h3>When does Wales’ ‘Duty of Care’ end for a Ukrainian if they return to Ukraine but decide to come back to Wales within the terms of the visa?</h3>
            <p>The Homes for Ukraine funding tariff is only available for the first 12 months after initial arrival. If someone goes and comes back during that 12 months, local authorities are expected to provide the same level of support as before. If the return happens after the 12 months, then, at present, we recognise that there is no funding to support an enhanced local authority service so mainstream services may have to be what is on offer.</p>
            <p>Welsh Government (as a sponsor for the super sponsor beneficiaries) has committed to providing 6 months accommodation (as with all sponsors). If someone on the Super Sponsor route left initial accommodation before 1 December 2022 and returns within 6 months to their initial accommodation, we will aim to fulfil our initial offer of up to 6 months accommodation. This offer would end 6 months after their initial arrival in the UK, rather than 6 months from their return to the UK.</p>
            <p>If someone leaves initial accommodation from 1 December 2022 onwards, they will be permitted only two weeks absence at a time (or a maximum of four weeks absence during their time in initial accommodation) before we may withdraw our offer of accommodation. </p>
            <p>If someone is post-6 months initial arrival or if they are on the Homes for Ukraine individual sponsor route, the local authority has homelessness duties which may need to be engaged. We are still exploring how we will support those who remain in our initial accommodation when they reach the six-month mark after initial arrival in the UK.</p>

            <h3>A Ukrainian is self-sufficient as they have found their own accommodation and job. If this situation changes would the Local Authority need to provide support again?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Ukrainians have a right to Local Authority homelessness assistance for the duration of their three year visa. Within the Platform we would still expect the individual’s most recently known placement to be recorded, even if no further support is expected. These individuals should be set to Move on (IS05/ SS10) with the status reason as ‘self-supporting’.  Should these individuals return and receive the support from the Local Authority, their journey status and reason should be updated to reflect their new situation i.e. IS02 placed with a host family</p>

            <h3>If a Ukrainian leaves for more than 2 weeks and we release the room/accommodation, what happens if they return?</h3>
            <p>Two weeks is the standard time we are working towards before a room is reallocated. It’s recommended that a courtesy call is made to say the room is being reallocated but unless the current occupant explains they will be back within a reasonable amount of time, we need to have the room reallocated. The likelihood is that people may have left belongings in the room so the venue will need to try to contact the absent occupiers to discuss what will happen with those belongings regardless. If the individuals wish to return after this time, they should contact the Nation of Sanctuary Contact Centre, who will assess whether they are still eligible for support and re-allocate other initial accommodation, as required.</p>

            <h3>At which point are Local Authorities no longer responsible for a Ukrainian that has travelled to live in Wales? Is there a cut off point for returning on both the scheme and Visa? </h3>
            <p>During the three years of the Homes for Ukraine visa, the Ukrainian is eligible for support to live, work and claim Public Funds in the UK. During the first 12 months, the local authority is also able to claim additional Homes for Ukraine funds to provide enhanced services. Details are being established about funding support in the second year of the scheme.</p>
            <p>Homes for Ukraine visas have now cut off / void period due to absences from the UK. </p>

            <h3>What are the funding implications if they are away for more than two weeks?</h3>
            <p>The Welsh Government continues to receive funding for this person even during absence. The funding agreements we have in place with Local Authorities for wraparound support is not always tied to the number of people accommodated on any given day. However, where that is the case, the funding for that person would stop if the room were not reallocated.</p>

            <h3>Should the Local Authority trace people when they unexpectantly leave Initial Accommodation?</h3>
            <p>The Local Authority’s responsibility is to inform the Contact Centre that someone has not returned. The Contact Centre will try to trace them and record them as missing, if appropriate.</p>

            <h3>Should a baby born to a Ukrainian family, which has travelled under the Super Sponsor or Individual Sponsor route, be added to the Data Platform? </h3>
            <p> “A child who is a Ukrainian national, or who is born in the UK after 18 March and has Ukrainian national parents, is eligible for leave to remain under the Ukraine extension scheme. Where the 18 March date is not relevant, there is provision for a child born in the UK to Ukraine parents who had leave to be in the UK before 1 January which has expired.” (Source: Home Office)</p>
            <p>In terms of whether they need to be added to the UDP, the answer is ‘no.’ Our rationale for the UDP data is that individuals are on Homes for Ukraine and we need to know their whereabouts and services for safeguarding assurance and financial reporting to ensure services are provided effectively – but that doesn’t apply where the Ukraine Extension Scheme is the visa held (there is no Integration Tariff available in those circumstances). That being said, it would be helpful to all involved to ensure a case note is added to relevant individuals’ records to show that they have additional dependent children who are not recorded on the UDP.</p>

            <h3>What happens to payments following the end of the initial schemes – will they be extended?</h3>
            <p>There is no plan to extend payments beyond the 12 month post-arrival period. UK Government has confirmed that a Housing support fund will be available in the second year of the scheme but details are still being established and the fund is unlikely to be apportioned equally to all Homes for Ukraine visa holders. </p>

            <h3>What happens when a sponsor is no longer willing to host the applicant?</h3>
            <p>In this instance the status of sponsor/host should be recorded as withdrawn on the data platform and a case note added to the applicants record to explain the situation. Although a Jira ticket can be raised in this situation, if the visa has already been granted the applicant already has the rights to come to the UK. Recommended steps would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Local Authority of the withdrawn sponsor/host to contact the applicant to offer them an alternative vetted host as an option </li>
                <li>Alternatively, you may be able to advise the applicant to join the Reset database to look for a rematch </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the Difference between Re-matches and Re-assignments?</h3>
            <p>There are key differences between the terms Re-match and Re-assignment, please see below definitions:</p>
            <p><b>Re-matching</b> is the process of a visa holder finding or being found a new accommodation placement. This can be in the form of a hosted placement or private rental placement. Re-matching can happen in lots of scenarios, including because of hosting breakdown, the scheduled end of a host placement, movement to another area for various reasons, or movement from Initial Accommodation (also known as ‘Move On’). In the context of the Ukraine Data Platform, re-matching involves the process of ending on placement and creating the follow-up placement tracking record.</p>
            <p><b>Adverse hit re-sponsoring</b> is the process of a visa applicant being matched with a secondary sponsor for their application after their initial sponsor was rejected during checks. Rejection through these checks is called an ‘Adverse Hit’. Rather than refuse the visa application, the UK Government’s policy is to offer the applicant an opportunity to find a secondary sponsor who can support the application. If that sponsor passes the checks, the visa will be granted and the visa holder will be able to travel to the UK. In the Ukraine Data Platform, we will flag the failed sponsors to ensure these are known to the relevant local authority. This is to ensure failed sponsors are not given the opportunity to become hosts. Becoming a host includes a DBS check and property inspection but does not include a check of the Police National Computer or Home Office Warnings Index. The UDP flag therefore provides additional safeguarding assurance.</p>
            <p><b>Re-assignment</b> is the process of ensuring visa holder records transfer from one local authority to another, as a result of a rematch into a new area. The Ukraine Data Platform does not permit full access to all records for every local authority. Only the local authority can view records of those linked to their area. Therefore, if a visa holder moves to a new local authority a re-assignment process must take place to ensure data transfers appropriately. The purpose of this is to ensure visa holders are properly safeguarding and supported in their new area and to ensure financial support is properly allocated between local authorities for the delivery of public services.</p>
            <p><b>Cross-border re-assignment</b> this is a type of re-assignment where visa holders move from one nation of the UK to another. Wales, Scotland and England/NI use different data platforms to store and process data relating to visa holders in each nation. As a result, there is a more complex process for ensuring records are appropriately allocated when visa holders move across a national boundary. For Wales, the Wales Nation of Sanctuary contact centre acts as the intermediary between Welsh local authorities and local authorities in other parts of the UK. They can help to process cross-border re-assignments correctly.</p>
