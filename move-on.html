                <h2 id="The-Move-On-Process" class="y-target">Acronym's Section</h2>
                <p>Prior to July 2023, the way in which we handled the move-on process was using a spreadsheet solution sitting in an Objective Connect environment to enable sharing. </p>
                <p>Move-on functionality was previously not developed in UDP as at the time there was insufficient time to stand-up a solution and the UDP information governance restrictions hindered our ability to make the move-on data available across all local authorities.</p>
                <p>The move-on process has become the key focus of the Ukraine programme. In closing Initial Accommodation (IA) and Welcome Centres (WC) the overarching aim is to move people from WC/IA accommodation to longer term accommodation including hosted accommodation. We are also looking to place new applicant arrivals directly into hosted accommodation to reduce use of initial accommodation.</p>
                <p>There is now a more definitive need to incorporate the move on process into the UDP and by doing so will reduce data duplication, provide a more consistent approach to managing move-on, make processes easier and will provide us with a complete single source of the truth.</p>
                <p>The new process, as such, will remain quite like the current process: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>EOI offers will need to be triaged by the local authority. </li>
                    <li>All standard housing and DBS checks will need to be completed.</li>
                    <li>Once checks have successfully been completed the property will be made available to all LA’s when searching.</li>
                    <li>LA’s will be able to locate properties based on the criteria set out in the housing need for each household.</li>
                    <li>A property can be reserved by any LA and once reserved, becomes unavailable to others that are using the move on search function. </li>
                    <li>Once matching has been completed a placement tracking will be auto created.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>New processes that will be introduced following the move into the UDP (on 5th July 2023) will be as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There will be no requirement to upload the EOI manually into the UDP and you will not be required to enter data previously received via Objective Connect (this will be made Read Only) .  All EOI’s that come through the Welsh Government Homes for Ukraine smart survey will be automatically uploaded via a data load.</li>
                    <li>The LA will be responsible for inputting information into a new ‘offered property’ tab which will help aid the search functionality. </li>
                    <li>The new search functionality will ensure that only one property can be reserved at a time.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Please Note:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>EOI’s that are matched outside of the smart survey, usually as a result of self-matching will still have to be manually uploaded to the platform.</li>
                    <li>The move on process will also amalgamate <b>all</b> available hosts – not just EOI’s.  This means that when a household leaves their hosted accommodation and the host is still willing to host another family, the LA can recycle this record to be used within the reservation process on the move on search tab. </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <div class="article-divider"></div>
            <section>
                <h2 id="eoi-data-feed" class="y-target">EOIs and the Data Feed </h2>
                <p>All data we receive from the EOI smart survey will automatically be uploaded into the UDP.  The data will be split into two parts and will feed into the relevant sections.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>EOI data that relates to the host / host address</b> will be uploaded into the system as a sponsor record for that host address.  The sponsor will be created automatically based on the information generated from the smart survey and will sit with the local authority where the host address is located. </li>
                    <li><b>EOI data that relates to the offer of the property</b> will be separated and linked into the fields on the offered property tab within the host address section.</li>
                    <p>It will be the Local Authority’s responsibility to contact the proposed host to clarify the data and capture any missing information.</p>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <div class="article-divider"></div>
            <section>
                <h2 id="contact-centre" class="y-target">LA / Contact Centre Responsibilities for the Move On Process</h2>
                <p>Both the contact centre and each respective LA will have responsibilities within the UDP to ensure that the move on process runs smoothly.</p>
                <h4>Contact Centre Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>The Contact Centre’s responsibility within the move on process is to ensure that direct allocations for Super Sponsor applicants runs smoothly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overarching concept of direct allocation to hosts includes allocating arrivals through the Welsh Government Super Sponsor Scheme to hosts prior to their arrival in Wales.  People will travel directly to hosts on arrival in the UK rather than placed in initial accommodation. Directly allocating people reduces the demand on initial accommodation and the need for local authorities to move people on from initial accommodation.  </li>
                    <li>The Contact Centre will identify available host offers via the move on search.  They will then liaise with local authorities to coordinate the direct allocations and matching people to suitable hosts. People will not be directly allocated to a host by the Contact Centre without the agreement of the receiving local authority.  The intention is to directly allocate all new arrivals to hosts where suitable host offers are identified.  People will be offered initial accommodation in the form of a Welcome Centre or holiday park where a suitable host is not available.    </li>
                    <li>The Contact Centre will liaise between hosts and guests regarding arrival and travel to Wales.  The contact centre will also manage the reservation process via the UDP to ensure that household records are linked and moved to the owning Local Authority of the new host / host address once the reservation process has been completed. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Local Authority Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>Each local authority will need to ensure that they have completed the following.</p>
                <p>For Households/Applicants:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every Household within their LA has a completed Housing Need Tab.</li>
                    <li>When a person joins or leaves the household the Housing Need Tab is updated to reflect the new household set up.</li>
                    <li>The household timeline is updated with any important (but non sensitive) notes regarding the household. </li>
                    <li>When actioning the move on search the LA must do this from the household tab and should consider the household needs when filtering their search. </li>
                    <li>When a property has been reserved the LA must liaise with the host address Local Authority (if this is different to their own)</li>
                    <li>When a property has been reserved, process the reservation through the stages, via the reservation status dropdowns, until the match is complete – regardless of whether the property is in your LA or not.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For sponsors/hosts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For every Sponsor or host (EOI), all sponsor and household checks must be completed and toggled before the property is made available in the move on search.</li>
                    <li>Keep track of each reserved property within your LA (by means a of a view)</li>
                    <li>Keep track of any hosts and host addresses that become available after their applicants have vacated to conduct a triage call for potential further hosting responsibilities (accessed by means of a view)</li>
                    <li>Liaise with LAs who reserve one of your properties for their household – to arrange meetings and travel. </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <div class="article-divider"></div>

                <h2 id="housing-need" class="y-target">Housing Need Section</h2>
                <p>The housing need section is now a tab within the household page. You will no longer access the housing need via the ‘Linked housing need’ field on the household page, this has been removed.  Although the record may look the same, we have developed and added a few fields that will contribute to assisting the matching process. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Update the linked housing need requirement for the existing household.  </li>
                    <li>Create a new housing need for the person that has been moved (if they are not joining another group).  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every Household ID, where the household is seeking new accommodation, should have a completed housing need tab which helps Local Authority colleagues when matching individuals to suitable accommodation, whether that be for individuals needing to be re-housed via the super sponsor scheme or for individuals who have arrived on the individual sponsor scheme.</p>
